## Install a virtual environment and launch the program

We recommend that you install the needed python libraries in a virtual environment. Here is how you can do:

Create a virtual environment in the folder where you cloned the projet:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
Then activate it and download the required libraries:
```
.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
